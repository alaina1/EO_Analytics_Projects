# EO_Analytics_Projects
Repo for EO Analytics 

##Purpose
This Repo is intended as a place for EO Analytics team members to submit finished code.  It doesn't necessarily have to be in a product, but it's at a good point to share for other's learning purposes and/or code reviews.

##Suggestions for Code Review
If you are interested in reviewing a peer's code, first create an unchanged copy of their code with "_<FirstLastInitials>Comment" appended to the end.  This way, the person requesting the review can tell who is the one giving feedback on certain updates/comments/concerns.
